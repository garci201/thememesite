	<p id="paragraph-intro">
The term “meme” was created by evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins, in his book The Selfish Gene. The book presents a gene-based view of evolution leading to the argument that living beings evolve based on genetics. The innate desire to produce to create more in your gene pool or being apathetic to those who are too genetically different. What does this have to do with memes? 
	Dawkins talks about memes in the final chapter as their own life entity. That they are a communicative life form between humans to share culture and experiences. They have their own evolution cycle and are subject to the same natural selection and genetic mutations as humans. Which makes sense as when memes are “viral” they end up like a virus populating everyone’s lives even if they do not want it to.
This is why I have such a personal connection to memes as many others do. 
	Whether it is Gen Z on Tiktok or Baby Boomers reading the newspaper comics. Memes are in the lives of everyone. But is that such a bad thing? Bringing humor to the indescribable lives we lead to make even an inkling of sense to life? I do not think so and even want to celebrate what memes have done for me.
	My name is Kaela Garcia, I was born in 2001 and as the internet and I grew up together I have quite the history with memes. I know memes have existed before I was born, but I want to highlight and thank the memes of my life. And how they made me into the person I am today. Whether they were a benefit or caused irreversible brain damage we will find out.
